# Ideas

- Rather than show individual tracks, show blocks of listening
- When a listen block is pressed then a popover shows the tracks played
- The block can be played or individual tracks can be
- Have Spotify music player at the bottom of the screen
- Show Finger's tracks to get side by side events

# Future
- For BBC the same concept of a show is an event, click the event to see the tracks and play them
- Can leave it playing so go through the day to the next show or the next show in the series
- Show different radio stations to get side by side events

- Add event schema markup to events
- Can events be downloaded and opened within Calendar app or gmail for example? This would create a Spotify playlist and populate notes:

eg.
13 Tracks
Show top 3 track in most played artist desc order

## For both Spotify & BBC
- Could use websockets to update the calendar in realtime as tracks are played on Spotify
