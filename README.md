# Have I Played Bowie Today? Calendar

This is a calendar view of Have I Played Bowie Today but is fixed to only show my own data at present.

- The UI is based on the Mac OS Calendar app
- The colour scheme is up in the air and I'm not entirely satisfied with it
- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) has been used for CSS but as its my first time using the library the implementation is a bit messy. I've taken different approaches in various places to try out features.
- Data fetching is done using [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- Using NextJS but with Preact used in the compiled version instead of React
- There is a dependency on Redis

There are some [ideas](./Ideas.md) on what I want to add in time.
